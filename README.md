Don't use this software. il-pleut is a _shitty_ BitTorrent client.

The goal of this project was to try out agentic programming (or is it called vibe coding?). The only lines that have been written by my own fingies are the ones in this README.

Agentic seems quite powerful, but also limited. I won't share more thoughts here.

This project was implemented in only a couple of hours. I have not reviewed any of the code. If the build failed, I simply asked Claude to fix it.

Claude Sonnet 4 is the LLM used for this project.

I did get to learn about the BitTorrent protocol while implementing this project; and I was able to download a Ubuntu image using this shitty client.
